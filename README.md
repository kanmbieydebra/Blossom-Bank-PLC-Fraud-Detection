An online fraud detection using varying Machine Learning models

Blossom Bank Online Payment Fraud Detection using Machine Learning.
The following steps were carried out in achieving the aim of the analysis:
1.	Data collection
2.	Data preparation
3.	Data cleaning
4.	EDA
5.	Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate analysis
6.	Feature engineering
7.	Model selection, training, and validation
8.	Model evaluation


The multivariate analysis took a while before I could figure it out, but I was glad I was able to do it.

Four supervised learning models were selected, tested, trained, and validated and then compared to determine which model had the best accuracy, precision, and recall score.
